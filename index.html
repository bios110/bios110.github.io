			<h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
			<p>Polluting a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of sacrifice, <abbr title="😭">tears</abbr>, <abbr title="😕">loneliness</abbr>, and abandoned civilizations.</p>
			<p>We must clear the mind of the past. Enlightenment with this interface has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folks that like the realm of <abbr title="🧬🕖">Quantum Mechanics</abbr> and <abbr title="📱">Solid state materials</abbr>.</p>
			<p>BIOS invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating motion. Become one with the universe.</p>

			<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
			<p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="The fox 🦊">OOOOO </abbr>. Consider the fox 🦊, big blue eyes, pointy nose, chassing mice, and digging hole. Tiny paws up the hill, suddenly it's standing still. Your fur is red, so beautiful, like an angel in disguise. But if the fox meets a friendly horse, will it communicate by moorse code? How would you speak to that hoorse? Jacha-chacha-chacha-chow! Chacha-chacha-chacha-chow! Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow! A-hee-ahee ha-hee! A-oo-oo-oo-ooo! Woo-oo-oo-ooo!</p>
			<p>The secret of the fox. Ancient mystery. Somewhere deep in the woods. I know you're hiding. What is your sound? Will we ever know? </p>
		<!--	<p> Will always be a mystery. What do you say? You're my guardian angel, hiding in the woods. What is your sound? Will we ever know? I want to know! The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be. </p>  once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure.  -->

			<h3>Partake</h3>
			<p>Dog goes woof. Cat goes meow. Bird goes tweet and mouse goes squeek. Cow goes moo. Frog goes croak and the elephant goes toot. Ducks say quack and fish go blub and the seal goes ow ow ow.</p>
			<p>But there's one sound, that no one knows.... What does the fox 🦊 say? Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding! Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding! Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow! Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho! Joff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!</p>

			<p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how amazing <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.</p>

			<h3>Research</h3>
			<p>Artificial Intelligence algorithms for anomaly detection and classification of real­time data. <abbr title= "tunnel transmissions"> Quantum Information Processing </abbr>, Artificial Intelligence, Optimisation and Pattern Recognition. We develop technologies realisable with current or future industrial implementation. We specialise in algorithms and protocols for quantum devices. Examples of applications are in the financial industry (high value transactions), digital cash, and information transfer over distributed networks.</p>
			
			<p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
			<p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We&#8217;re well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>
			<p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <a href="/pages/submit/guidelines/">submission guidelines</a>), but we ask you release your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a Creative Commons license identical to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" title="View the Zen Garden's license information.">one on this site</a> so that others may learn from your work.</p>
